## Installation, Layout, and Compilation

See
[introduction](http://github.com/alecjacobson/geometry-processing-introduction).

## Execution

Once built, you can execute the assignment from inside the `build/` using 

    ./registration [path to mesh1.obj] [path to mesh2.obj]

### Why is my code so slow?

Try profiling your code. Where is most of the computation time spent?

If you have done things right, the majority of time is spent computing
point-to-mesh distances. For each query point, the [computational
complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory) of
computing its distance to a mesh with $m$ faces is $O(m)$.

This can be _dramatically_ improved (e.g., to $O(\log m)$ on average) using an
[space partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_partitioning) data
structure such as a [kd tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree), a
[bounding volume
hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy), or
[spatial hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_(computational_geometry)).

You could follow [this assignment from our graphics course](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-bounding-volume-hierarchy) to learn how to implement an AABB tree.

## Tasks

### Read \[Bouaziz 2015\]

This reading task is not directly graded, but it's expected that you read and
understand sections 3.2-3.3 of Sofien Bouaziz's PhD thesis "Realtime Face
Tracking and Animation" 2015. _Understanding_ this may require digging into
wikipedia, other online resources or other papers.

### Blacklist

You may not use the following libigl functions:

- `igl::AABB`
- `igl::fit_rotations`
- `igl::hausdorff`
- `igl::iterative_closest_point`
- `igl::point_mesh_squared_distance`
- `igl::point_simplex_squared_distance`
- `igl::polar_dec`
- `igl::polar_svd3x3`
- `igl::polar_svd`
- `igl::random_points_on_mesh`
- `igl::rigid_alignment`
- `Eigen::umeyama`

### Whitelist

You are encouraged to use the following libigl functions:

- `igl::cumsum` computes cumulative sum
- `igl::doublearea` computes triangle areas
- `igl::per_face_normals` computes normal vectors for each triangle face
- `Eigen::JacobiSVD` computes singular value decomposition of a matrix

### `src/point_mesh_distance.cpp`
Compute the distances `D` between a set of given points `X` and their closest
points `P` on a given mesh with vertex positions `VY` and face indices `FY`.
For each point in `P` also output a corresponding normal in `N`.

> It is OK to assume that all points in `P` lie inside (rather than exactly at
> vertices or exactly along edges) for the purposes of normal computation in
> `N`.

### `src/hausdorff_lower_bound.cpp`
Compute a lower bound on the _directed_ Hausdorff distance from a given mesh
(`VX`,`FX`) to another mesh (`VY`,`FY`). This function should be implemented by
randomly sampling the $X$ mesh.

### `src/closest_rotation.cpp`
Given a $3\times 3$ matrix `M`, find the closest rotation matrix `R`.

### `src/point_to_point_rigid_matching.cpp`
Given a set of source points X and corresponding target points P, find the
optimal rigid transformation (R,t) that aligns X to P, minimizing the
point-to-point matching energy.

### `src/point_to_plane_rigid_matching.cpp`
Given a set of source points `X` and corresponding target points `P` and their
normals `N`, find the optimal rigid transformation (`R`,`t`) that aligns `X` to
planes passing through `P` orthogonal to `N`, minimizing the point-to-point
matching energy.

### `src/icp_single_iteration.cpp`
Conduct a _single iteration_ of the iterative closest point method align
(`VX`,`FX`) to (`VY`,`FY`) by finding the rigid transformation (`R`,`t`)
minimizing the matching energy.

The caller can specify the number of samples `num_samples` used to approximate
the integral over $X$ and specify the `method` (point-to-point or
point-to-plane).
